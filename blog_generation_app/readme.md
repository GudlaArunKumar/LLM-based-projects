# Blog Generation App 

This project is to generate a blog for a given user prompt with the following options. 
* Input Text 
* Number of Words
* Blog Style 

The Projet uses `Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML` model from Hugging Face by using CTransformer implementation by `LangChain`. For simplicity, model is downloaded locally and only local CPU is used to run the model.
